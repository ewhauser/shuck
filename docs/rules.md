# Rule Implementation Roadmap

## Summary

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Implemented | 99 |
| Scheduled (Tranches 1-3) | 18 |
| Remaining | 201 |
| **Total** | **318** |

## Difficulty Legend

- **L** (Low) — Simple fact filter or AST pattern match; minimal false-positive logic
- **M** (Medium) — Cross-references multiple facts, needs option parsing, context-aware filtering, or moderate false-positive avoidance
- **H** (High) — Needs new fact infrastructure, semantic/dataflow analysis, cross-function reasoning, or complex scope logic
- Entry markers use two checkboxes: first = implemented, second = vetted (`V`)
- `V` means the rule was reviewed for performance, direct AST traversal in rule files, and duplication; it does not mean the implementation is issue-free
- The checker currently contains additional implemented rules that are not yet enumerated in this roadmap, so vetted markers below apply to the documented implemented rows only

## Scheduled Tranches

These rules are queued for implementation and tracked separately.

**Tranche 1:** ~~C003~~, ~~C004~~, ~~C012~~, C016, C023, C024, C026, C027, C028, C029, C030, C031, C032, C033, C034

**Tranche 2:** ~~C035~~, ~~C036~~, ~~C037~~, ~~C038~~, ~~C039~~, ~~C040~~, ~~C041~~, ~~C042~~, ~~C043~~, C044, C045, C049, C051, C052, C053

**Tranche 3:** ~~C054~~, ~~C056~~, ~~C059~~, ~~C060~~, ~~C061~~, ~~C062~~, ~~C064~~, ~~C065~~, ~~C066~~, ~~C067~~, ~~C068~~, ~~C069~~, ~~C070~~, ~~C071~~, ~~C072~~ *(complete)*

## Vetting Findings

Review scope: all currently dispatched rule entrypoints under `crates/shuck-linter/src/rules/`, with focus on performance costs, direct AST traversal from rule files, and duplication.

- No direct AST-traversal violations were found in rule files during this pass. The architecture guard `cargo test -p shuck-linter rule_modules_avoid_direct_ast_traversal_tokens` passed.

## Validation Review (2026-04-10)

The reviewed implemented rules below were checked against three gates:

1. rule logic uses facts APIs only (no direct AST walks or traversal helpers in rule modules)
2. rule logic avoids duplicating command/AST extraction work that belongs in facts
3. test coverage includes both triggering and non-trigger/edge scenarios

| Rule | Facts-only / no walks | Duplication | Coverage status | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C141 `loop-without-end` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ positive plus balanced/nested non-trigger tests | vetted |

- [x] Sync the already-reviewed structural parse-diagnostic roadmap markers (`C142`, `C143`, `C146`, `C157`) after reconfirming their shared parse-diagnostic ownership and regression coverage.
- [x] Sync the already-reviewed security roadmap markers (`K001`, `K004`) after reconfirming their shared command-fact ownership and regression coverage.
- [ ] Move `C108` unset associative-array operand parsing into facts or shared unset-option data so the rule file stops reparsing `name[key]` text and quote state on its own.
- [ ] Move `S063` symlink-target selection into facts or shared `ln` option parsing so the rule file stops reconstructing `ln -s/-t/--` operand semantics on its own.
- [ ] Move `X035` function-parameter fallback detection into facts or shared parse-diagnostic infrastructure so the rule file stops reconstructing paired commands and source layout on its own.
- [ ] Decide whether `X077` should remain listed as implemented; either add a real matcher with triggering regression coverage or explicitly document it as an oracle-parity no-op.
- [ ] Move the shared function binding and call-arity resolution behind `C097`/`C123` into facts or a shared semantic helper so the rule files stop duplicating visible-binding lookup and function-span trimming.
